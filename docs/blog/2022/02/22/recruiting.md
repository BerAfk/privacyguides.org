Membership is recognition of significant or sustained contributions to the our community. We help build Privacy Guides, run privacy-friendly services and communities, and promote the use of privacy-respecting tools and services internationally as a means to stop or fight back against global mass surveillance programs. Join us!

There are many different ways of contributing to Privacy Guides. Contributions are valued and recognised whether you contribute to translations, artwork, website code, providing support on the forums or Reddit, being active and helpful in Matrix, marketing, advocacy, or anything else! The whole community and team depend on each other. Any way that you choose to bring benefit to our organisation is incredibly appreciated.

We also recognise involvement in the wider privacy and security community - such as contributions to the projects, tools, and services we recommend on the site. However, while contributions to these projects are worth recognition and appreciated, involvement with the the organisation directly is required for membership.

If you love the project, and really want to help out then apply by contacting `freddy@privacyguides.org`.

Please note: Privacy Guides is run by unpaid volunteers. None of the members receive any monetary incentive for maintaining the project. If you join this also applies.
